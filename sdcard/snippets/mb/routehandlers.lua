-- luacheck: globals mb

-- This all-key, central key router forwards Keybow key events to their
-- correct handlers, depending on which keyboard layout currently is active.
--
-- A keymap grab will always only route keys to the "grabbing" keymap, and to
-- no other keymap. Without a keymap grab in place, permanent keymaps will be
-- searched first for a matching key definition, with the first hit to score.
-- The current keymap will be considered only last, after all permanent
-- keymaps have been exhausted.
--
-- Additionally, "any" keyhandlers will be considered only for (1) the
-- grabbing keymap (if a grab is active) and for (2) the current keymap.
-- Permanent keymaps cannot have "any" key handlers (or rather, they will be
-- ignored.)
